## Functions

top_stories = tna.get_top_stories()
    
print(top_stories)
```
#### All News

import thenewsapi

tna = thenewsapi.TheNewsAPIClient(API_KEY)
    
all_news = tna.get_all_news()
    
print(all_news)

import thenewsapi

tna = thenewsapi.TheNewsAPIClient(API_KEY)
    
similar_news = tna.get_similar_news(NEWS_UUID)
    
print(similar_news)
```
#### News By UUID
```
import thenewsapi

tna = thenewsapi.TheNewsAPIClient(API_KEY)
    
news_by_uuid = tna.get_news_by_uuid(NEWS_UUID)
    
print(news_by_uuid)
```
#### Sources
```
import thenewsapi

tna = thenewsapi.TheNewsAPIClient(API_KEY)
    
sources = tna.get_sources()
    
print(sources)
```
#### Headlines (Standard+ tier needed)
```
import thenewsapi

tna = thenewsapi.TheNewsAPIClient(API_KEY)
    
headlines = tna.get_headlines()
    
print(headlines)

If you want to use multiple values for one param, I suggest you use lists to make it more relateable, like:
```
tna.get_top_stories(locale=['ae','ar'])
```
